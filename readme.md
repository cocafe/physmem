#### Usage

This program utilizes some IOCTL APIs provided by `asmmap64.sys` to implement related features.

Please make sure `asmmap64.sys` is in the same folder with `physmem.exe`. 

```
Usage:
       physmem.exe [options] read8    <addr>
       physmem.exe [options] read16   <addr>
       physmem.exe [options] read32   <addr>
       physmem.exe [options] read64   <addr>
       physmem.exe [options] readblk  <addr> <bytes>
       physmem.exe [options] write8   <addr> <value>
       physmem.exe [options] write16  <addr> <value>
       physmem.exe [options] write32  <addr> <value>
       physmem.exe [options] write64  <addr> <value>
       physmem.exe [options] writeblk <addr> <bytes> <byte0> <byte1> ...
       physmem.exe [options] driver install
       physmem.exe [options] driver remove
Options:
       -h              this help text
       -v              verbose print
       -s              no readback after writing
       -m <bytes>      mmap size, default: 8
       -x              always remove asmmap64 driver on exit
       -f              force remove driver for command "driver remove"
       -C              hexdump style print

```

```shell
# read 1 byte with hexdump format
physmem.exe -C read8 0xfed159a0

# read 8 bytes
physmem.exe read64 0xfed159a0

# read 8 bytes block and display in hexdump format
physmem.exe readblk 0xfed159a0 8

# write 8 bytes
physmem.exe write64 0xfed159a0 0x0042820000FE8200

# write 8 bytes silently
physmem.exe -s write64 0xfed159a0 0x0042820000FE8200

# write 8 bytes block
physmem.exe writeblk 0xfed159a0 8 00 82 FE 00 00 82 42 00
